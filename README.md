In this pandemic situation our doctors and hospital staff are doing their best as much as they can. The extra time needed to update staff and family. As the workload intensifies, staffing models and operations will also need to adapt. So the main problem arrives from here only that how to manage the staff work. 
This problem is related to the staff which is assigned in the area of corona patients. There are other staffs also in the hospital but weâ€™re not including them as the main point is related to current pandemic. The hospital staffs are largely in the risk of getting corona positive because they are dealing with patients. So, the major duty of the hospital is that to keep their staff safe and healthy and providing them all the necessary things.
